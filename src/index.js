      'Bumblebee is the "little brother" of the heroic Autobots and a mascot, constantly striving to prove himself in the eyes of the other robots—especially his leader, Optimus Prime. This often causes him to take risks and put himself in danger. He is portrayed as a smart aleck, a capable, reliable messenger and spy, and his small size allows him to go places that his larger commanders cannot. He is highly fuel-efficient, has great visual acuity, is particularly adaptable to undersea environments, and transforms into a Saturn yellow Volkswagen Beetle. He was later reconstructed into a stronger, more mature form as Goldbug.',

      "Ratchet is the Autobots' Chief Medical Officer. If something's broke, he can fix it. Ratchet is known for his irreverent bedside manner; he loves having a good time, and his party-loving nature has given him a dry wit. He is not a particularly mighty warrior, which sometimes leads him to believe that he is expendable. Optimus Prime has trouble convincing Ratchet that this is far from the truth.",

      "Ironhide is one of the oldest and toughest Autobots, and has been on Optimus Prime's team for a long time. \"They don't make them like they used to\" is an apt description of Ironhide—he's yesterday's model, but he's built to last. Gruff and ornery, he prefers actions to words, and dislikes talk for talk's sake. (He wouldn't enjoy being paired up with Bluestreak.) But though he may be rough around the edges, he's still optimistic and upbeat. The upside to being through more than your share of trouble means trouble ain't so big a scare anymore.",

      " Jazz is one happy-go-lucky Autobot. Good-natured and always able to take things in stride, he provides a stark contrast to the more serious demeanor of Ironhide or Optimus Prime himself. He's also a talker, something Ironhide and Prime like to tease him about. He might be the smallest Autobot, but he's by no means a coward. Armed with a magnetic field generator in his Spark chamber and a crescent-shaped bi-thermal emitter that fires streams of super-cold liquid nitrogen or superheated plasma, he's willing to take on any foe, big or small.",
